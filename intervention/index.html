            Discussion of Results

        <p>
            One week after the date the proposals were submitted, the same questions were posted on Reddit for English
            and Yahoo
            Chiebukuro for Japanese.
            On Yahoo Chiebukuro, the question was viewed 26 times but received only one response. The reason for this,
            we assume, is
            that once one person has answered the question, others are no longer motivated to write additional answers
            or provide
            new ones. In the case of Reddit, we do not know the number of views, so it is not possible to examine the
            effect of this
            result in detail, but we expect that people would not be motivated to respond to serious topics on this
            site.

            If there is another opportunity, we would like to ask the question on a platform where there is more
            discussion, or in
            an environment where people are compelled to respond.
