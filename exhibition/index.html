    <h1>Retro Museum</h1>
    <h4>This collection is a treasure trove of retro-inspired Internet art, a collection of works inspired by computers
        and
        computer screens from the 1980s and 1990s. The combination of neon games and 8-bit sounds unique to PCs of the
        time, the
        design of the Macintosh OS when it was first released, and the most beloved OS of all, Windows XP and its green
        hills,
        all weave a new experience online. Not only what is on display, but the entire site will move interactively and
        give
        people a sense of nostalgia in terms of UX. Pixel art, old UI charm, and the good old internet atmosphere will
        all take
        users back to a world of nostalgic memories.
